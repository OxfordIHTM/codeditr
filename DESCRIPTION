Description: The World Health Organization's CoDEdit electronic tool is intended 
    to help producers of cause-of-death statistics in strengthening their 
    capacity to perform routine checks on their data. This package ports the
    original tool built using Microsoft Acess into R so as to leverage the
    utility and function of the original tool into a usable application
    program interface that can be used for building more universal tools or for
    creating programmatic scientific workflows aimed at routine, automated, and
    large-scale monitoring of cause-of-death data.
